% CHANCONV   Convert between representations of a quantum channel
% requires: TrX, schmidt, purification
% author: Toby Cubitt
% license: GPL2
%
%    S = chanconv(E,TO) converts the quantum channel E to the TO
%    representation, determining the input representation automatically.
%
%    S = chanconv(E,FROM,TO) converts the quantum channel E in the FROM
%    representation to the TO representation.
%
%    S = chanconv(E,TO,DIM) converts the quantum channel E to the TO
%    representation, determining the input representation
%    automatically. The input and output dimensions DIMA and DIMB of the
%    channel are specified by the vector DIM = [DIMA, DIMB].
%
%    S = chanconv(E,FROM,TO,DIM) converts the quantum channel E in the
%    FROM representation to the TO representation. The input and output
%    dimensions DIMA and DIMB of the channel are specified by the vector
%    DIM = [DIMA, DIMB].
%
%    [S,dim] = chancon(E, ...) returns the input, output and environment
%    dimensions of the channel in a vector DIM = [DIMA,DIMB,DIME].
%
%    FROM and TO must be one of:
%      'kraus' - a cell array containing a set of Kraus operators
%      'choi'  - a Choi-Jamiolkowski state representative density matrix
%      'linop' - a matrix representation of the linear operator
%      'isom'  - an isometry matrix
%      'state' - a purification of the Choi-Jamiolkowski state
%      'func'  - a function on density matrices which implements a channel
%      'pauli' - a Pauli representation of a qubit channel
%                (FIXME: not implemented)
%
%    The Kraus operators are the operators A_k acting from the *left* in
%    the Kraus decomposition (i.e. the action of the channel is given by
%    sum_k A_k rho A_k').
%
%    The entries of a Choi-Jamiolkowski state representative matrix
%    should be ordered so that the input system comes first, the output
%    second. I.e. it should be the state resulting from applying the
%    channel to the *second* half of an entangled state. Non-standard
%    Choi-Jamiolkowski states are allowed as input representations; there
%    is no requirement that the reduced state on the first subsystem be
%    the identity (i.e. it can result from applying the channel to the
%    first half of any full-Schmidt-rank entangled state, which need not
%    necessarily be maximally entangled).
%
%    Output Choi-Jamiolkowski state representatives follow the same
%    ordering convention, but the reduced state on the first subsystem is
%    always the identity (i.e. they are always the state resulting from
%    applying the channel to the second half of a canonical maximally
%    entangled state).
%
%    The entries of a state vector representation of a channel should be
%    ordered so that the subsystems occur in the following order: input
%    system, output system, environment. Ouput state vectors follow the
%    same ordering convention.
%
%    It is possible for the same matrix to simultaneously be a valid
%    Choi-Jamiolkowski state representative, a valid matrix
%    representation of the linear operator, and even a valid isometry.
%    Therefore the input representation can not always be inferred
%    unambiguously, and a reasonable guess must be made. The input
%    representation is assumed to be a Choi-Jamiolkowski state
%    representative if E is an (unnormalized) density matrix (i.e. is
%    Hermitian and positive, to within a tolerance of 10E-10). Otherwise
%    it is assumed to be a matrix representation of the linear
%    operator. However, to be absolutely sure the correct input
%    representation is used, you should specify it explicitly.
